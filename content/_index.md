-----------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------
[Regression Analysis for the Social Sciences](https://www.amazon.com/Regression-Analysis-Social-Sciences-2/dp/113881251X) | Gordon, Rachel | Routledge, 2015
[R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) | Grolemund, Wickham | O'Reilly, 1st edition, 2017

We will read a few chapters in [Applied Multiple Regression/Correlation Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences 3rd edition](https://www.amazon.com/Multiple-Regression-Correlation-Analysis-Behavioral/dp/0805822232) by Cohen et al from Routledge as supplement. 

Additional readings will be posted to [D2L/Readings](https://d2l.pdx.edu/d2l/le/content/667907/Home)

### Software

This course will use the R statistical software. R is free and available for download at http://cran.r-project.org. We will use RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com/) as our main interface to R. R and RStudio is installed on the lab computers across the campus. Labs will be offered weekly to assist in using R to complete the assignments and R examples will be used during regular sessions. I can provide additional assistance with the software. [DataQuest](https://www.dataquest.io) is a good resource to learn R along with data analysis skills. 

It is possible to use your choice of other stats software, such as SAS, SPSS, or Stata, for this class; I do encourage you to continue using one of these software if you are already using it. It is also a good idea to ask your graduate adviser and/or GRA supervisor which software would be most useful for you, and use it. If you plan to use one of these software, I will provide as much assistance as I can.

### Hardware

Class meets virutally via Zoom; you are welcome to bring and use your own laptop (Windows, Mac, or Linux). Check out the [Tools and Datasets](/tools) section for instructions of installing necessary software on your own computer.
