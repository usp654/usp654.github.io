### Grading:

3 homework assignments and the class project+paper will make up your entire grade in the course. I use these grading cutoffs:
- A=90%
- B=80% 
- C=70% 
- D=60% 
- F<60%

###	Notes

1. If my office hours conflict with your schedule, [send me a Google calendar invite for an appointment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bzErTafR_yILhhwW-1jax_0XiHZZE-HU-tT40Ur0blQ/edit).
1. Submit in your homework assignments to [D2L/Assignments](https://d2l.pdx.edu/d2l/lms/dropbox/user/folders_list.d2l?ou=822118&isprv=0). 
1. Academic dishonesty will result in a score of zero for the assignment in question. 
1. Please be aware of the Universityâ€™s policies on withdrawals and incompletes:
    - Withdrawals: https://www.pdx.edu/registration/withdraw-cancellation-and-drops
    - Incompletes: http://pdx.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2016-2017/Bulletin/Graduate-Studies/Enrollment/Incompletes
1. Good advice paraphrased from a former instructor of this course: Be active! The more you do in this course, the more you will learn. Apply the tools and concepts to your own/other data; see what you find; if it is interesting/confusing/etc., bring & show it to me! I can get you started, but good data analysts are driven by a curiosity they discover in themselves.  

###	Students with disabilities

If you have a disability and need academic accommodations, please let me know early in the term so we can make arrangements to meet your learning needs.

###	Title IX reporting obligations

As an instructor, one of my responsibilities is to help create a safe learning environment for my students and for the campus as a whole. Please be aware that as a faculty member, I have the responsibility to report any instances of sexual harassment, sexual violence and/or other forms of prohibited discrimination. If you would rather share information about sexual harassment, sexual violence or discrimination to a confidential employee who does not have this reporting responsibility, you can find a list (http://www.pdx.edu/sexual-assault/get-help) of those individuals. For more information about Title IX please complete the required student module Creating a Safe Campus in your D2L.
