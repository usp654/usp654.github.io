## Tools
### R + RStudio
[R](https://cran.r-project.org) is the statistical programming language we will use in this class. We will interface with R using [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com), a fully feautred Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Installing them on your own computer should be straightforward. If you already have them installed on your computer, I recommend you check the version and upgrade them to the latest version. Ask me for help if you have any problem installing them.

- Download and install R 4.0.2 from https://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/cran/ for your operating system. (Requires administrator privellege)
- Download and install RStudio Desktop free version from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

DataQuest kindly provides students in this class free premium access to their courses. I recommend these courses, but you're welcome to explore [other courses in their catalogue](https://app.dataquest.io/directory)

All content related course communication will happen on Slack, in the relevant channels. For personal matters (only) you can [email me](emailto:lmwang@pdx.edu).

## Datasets

Recommended datasets for class assignments and project:

1. American Housing Survey (AHS)

    AHS is a comprehensive housing survey in the U.S., provides up-to-date information on the size and composition of the housing stock.

1. American Community Survey (ACS)

    ACS is an ongoing survey by the U.S. Census Bureau that regularly gathers information previously contained only in the long form of the decennial census, such as ancestry, educational attainment, income, language proficiency, migration, disability, employment, and housing characteristics.

1. National Household Travel Survey (NHTS)

    NHTS provides information to assist transportation planners and policy makers who need comprehensive data on travel and transportation patterns in the United States. 2017 NHTS data can be downloaded [here](http://nhts.ornl.gov/download.shtml)
    
    The Oregon Household Activity Survey (OHAS) is a regional survey similar to NHTS, but the most recent survey is now a bit dated (2011-12). Talk to me if you're interested in using OHAS for your assignments/class project.

1. General Social Survey (GSS)

    GSS provides politicians, policymakers, and scholars with a clear and unbiased perspective on what Americans think and feel about such issues as national spending priorities, crime and punishment, intergroup relations, and confidence in institutions. All GSS data can be downloaded [here](http://gss.norc.org/get-the-data/spss)

1. California Health Interview Survey (CHIS)

    The California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) is the largest state health survey in the nation. It is a random-dial telephone survey that asks questions on a wide range of health topics.
