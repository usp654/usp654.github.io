 A=90% B=80% C=70% D=60% F&amp;lt;60%  Notes  If my office hours conflict with your schedule, send me a Google calendar invite for an appointment. Submit in your homework assignments to D2L/Assignments. Extensions on homework due dates will only be granted in exceptional circumstances and only if I am contacted before the due date.</description>

      <description>Tools R + RStudio R is the statistical programming language we will use in this class. We will interface with R using RStudio, a fully feautred IDE. Installing them on your own computer should be straightforward. If you already have them installed on your computer, I recommend you check the version and upgrade them to the latest version. Ask me for help if you have any problem installing them.
 Download and install R 3.</description>
