## Data manipulation with the `dplyr` package (part of `tidyverse`)
`dplyr` works most efficiently with "tidy data"

![Tidy Data](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/images/tidy-1.png)

It has 5 basic verbs for manipulating R data frame (or tibble):

- `mutate()` adds new variables that are functions of existing variables (Note there is a new column `kmpl` to the right)
```{r, echo=TRUE}
require(tidyverse)
# convert mpg to kilometers per liter
mtcars %>% mutate(kmpl = mpg * 0.425144)
```

(Note we do not assign the results back to `mtcars`, the new `kmpl` is for showing only and lost afterwards. To retain the new variable, assign the results back to `mtcars` or to a new name).

- `select()` picks variables based on their names.

The above example is hard to see the results as there are too many columns. Here only show the columns of interest:
```{r}
# convert mpg to kilometers per liter
mtcars %>% mutate(kmpl = mpg * 0.425144) %>% 
  select(mpg, kmpl)
```

- `filter()` picks cases based on their values.

Let's select cars with mpg above 20:
```{r, echo=TRUE}
# convert mpg to kilometers per liter
mtcars %>% filter(mpg > 20) %>% 
  select(mpg, cyl, hp)
```

How many cars are there with `mpg` > 20?
```{r, echo=TRUE}
# convert mpg to kilometers per liter
mtcars %>% filter(mpg > 20) %>% 
  nrow()
```

- `summarise()` reduces multiple values down to a single summary (working with `group_by()`).

Let's see how many cars with auto and manual transimission (`am`: 0-automatic, 1-manual):
```{r, echo=TRUE}
# convert mpg to kilometers per liter
mtcars %>% group_by(am) %>% 
  summarize(n=n())
```

Let's get the average mpg by the type of transimission (`am`: 0-automatic, 1-manual):
```{r, echo=TRUE}
# convert mpg to kilometers per liter
mtcars %>% group_by(am) %>% 
  summarize(mean_mpg=mean(mpg))
```

You can easily combine multiple `summarize` functions with the same grouping:
```{r, echo=TRUE}
# convert mpg to kilometers per liter
mtcars %>% group_by(am) %>% 
  summarize(n=n(),
            mean_mpg=mean(mpg),
            sd_mpg=sd(mpg),
            min_mpg=min(mpg),
            max_mpg=max(mpg))
```

- `arrange()` changes the ordering of the rows.

Let's reorder the mtcars by `mpg` (ascending by default):
```{r, echo=TRUE}
# convert mpg to kilometers per liter
mtcars %>% arrange(mpg)
```

Descending order:
```{r, echo=TRUE}
# convert mpg to kilometers per liter
mtcars %>% arrange(desc(mpg))
```

## Hypothesis testing of nested models

```{r, echo=TRUE}
###########################################
## General linear F test

require(tidyverse)

fit_R <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data=mtcars)
fit_F <- lm(mpg ~ wt + cyl, data=mtcars)

anova(fit_R, fit_F)


## To do the F test manually
SSE_R <- resid(fit_R)^2 %>% sum
SSE_F <- resid(fit_F)^2 %>% sum
df_R <- df.residual(fit_R)
df_F <- df.residual(fit_F)

F_val <- ((SSE_R - SSE_F)/(df_R - df_F))/(SSE_F/df_F)

# Look up the critical F value for alpha=0.05
alpha <- 0.05
qf(alpha, (df_R - df_F), df_F, lower.tail=F)

# Alternatively, find the p-value corresponding to our F_val
pf(F_val, (df_R - df_F), df_F, lower.tail=F)

###########################################

n <- nrow(mtcars)          # number of observations
k <- length(coef(fit_R))   # number of coefficients

## Calculate R2 and adjusted R2 manually
TSS <- sd(mtcars$mpg)^2 * (n - 1)
# OR
TSS <- var(mtcars$mpg) * (n - 1)

(R2_R <- 1 - SSE_R/TSS)
(R2_R_adj <- 1 - (SSE_R/(n - k))/(TSS/(n - 1)))
```

Note that R uses the term `RSS` (residual Sum Squares) instead of `SSE` (Sum Square Error) in the textbook, they are the same.

## Tasks

1. Load your dataset, and then use the `dplyr` verbs to manipulate it:
    - Add a new variable that is converted from (an) existing variable(s);
    - Select a subset of the observation based on (a) condition(s);
    - Count number of observations in your dataset with distinct values of a discrete numeric or a categorical variable (e.g, number of cars with 4, 6, and 8 cylinders);
    - Summarize the mean of a nuermic variable by values of a discrete/categorical variable (e.g. mean mpg for cars with auto or manual transmission(`am`));
1. Fit a pair of nested multiple regression models with your own dataset and use the general linear F test to test for significance between the restricted and full model:
    - What is your hypothesis? And what is the practical interpretation/implication of your hypothesis?
    - Think about whether your models are nested, which is the restricted model and the full model?
    - Even though you don't need to do this manually, think about how you'd conduct the hypothesis test manually;
    - Conduct an F test of your nested models and determine the conclusion of your hypothesis test;
    - What is the implication of the result of your hypothesis testing?
