# Why Regression Analysis?

- Regression analysis allows scientists to quantify how the average of one variable systematically varies according to the levels of another variable;
- Comparing with hypothesis testing techinque we reviewed before, additional variables can be introduced into regression models to help to determine if a relationship is genuine or spurious;
- Regression models also allow scientists to examine the mechanisms that their theories and ideas suggest explain the association between a particular predictor variable and an outcome;
- Regression models can be used to examine how two predictors jointly associate with an outcome variable;
- Regression models can be used for predictions or scenario analysis.
